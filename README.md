  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
  My project is a script that will take in user input through node to generate a well organized and detailed README. 
  To better help users to be able to create clean and professioanl looking README's.
  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
  Navigate to my GitHub page, then to the Proffessional-README-generator repo and copy the code. Then install the necessary JSON packages and you should be good to go!!
  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
  A good example of how this could be used is this project itself. This readme was generated using the script.
